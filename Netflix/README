- Refactored the content-based recommender into reusable Python functions
- Allows better structure, readability, and testing

- Accepts user input (movie + genre optional)
- Generates unseen movie recommendations
- Includes rating distribution plots
- Shows similar users' favorite genres and movies

## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used:
- Python, pandas, numpy
- Scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use:
- Run each notebook step by step
- Try inputting different movie names
